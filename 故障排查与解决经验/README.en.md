This directory contains sanitized Codex and companion-tool incident records with explicit evidence boundaries. Start with the symptom table. You do not need to understand the directory layout or read every investigation.

## Find a case by symptom

| ID | Symptom | Current status | Entry |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TRB-001` | Archiving on Windows reports `thread-store` / `os error 2`, although the session file exists | **Resolved: local repair verified** | [Archive-path failure](<01-会话与归档/TRB-001-Windows归档路径异常/TRB-001-2-thread-store-归档路径缺失.md>) |
| `TRB-002` | The original task shows `thread not found`, while its record may still exist | **Partially resolved: one recovery case verified** | [`thread not found` recovery](<01-会话与归档/TRB-002-thread-not-found/TRB-002-thread-not-found-恢复方案.md>) |
| `TRB-003` | Tasks disappear from the list after an account or route switch, although files remain | **Partially resolved: historical workaround verified** | [Split history lists](<02-账号与供应商切换/TRB-003-历史列表分裂/TRB-003-历史列表分裂-账号切换后无法共享对话.md>) |
| `TRB-004` | A task remains visible but cannot continue after an account or provider switch and reports ciphertext validation errors | **Partially resolved: no general fix** | [Old task cannot continue](<02-账号与供应商切换/TRB-004-旧对话无法继续/TRB-004-旧对话无法继续-账号切换后无法继续.md>) |
| `TRB-005` | Migration is followed by `invalid paginated history lineage` or an out-of-range cutoff | **Unresolved: real operations suspended** | [Paginated-lineage damage](<02-账号与供应商切换/TRB-005-迁移后分页谱系损坏/TRB-005-invalid-paginated-history-lineage-分页谱系损坏与迁移暂停.md>) |
| `TRB-006` | Messages between AI tasks receive no reply, repeat an old answer, end in an empty turn, or receive no acknowledgment | **Unresolved: log-based diagnosis and prevention procedures available; automatic interception not implemented** | [AI task messages receive no reply: diagnosis and prevention](<03-跨任务通信/TRB-006-AI任务间消息不回复-排查与预防.md>) |
| `TRB-007` | A long task reports an explicit conversation-too-long 400, 401, unsupported-model 404, 429, either of two 502 signatures, 503, 504, or a dropped stream | **Partially resolved: triage and recovery available; failures still observed after the reported fix** | [Long tasks and HTTP errors index](<04-网络与上游错误/TRB-007-长任务断联与HTTP错误/TRB-007-总索引-跨错误码证据与共用流程.md>) |

“Resolved” applies only to the platform, version, and evidence scope stated in the case. “Partially resolved” means that a verified recovery or workaround exists while the root cause, durable fix, or other environments remain open. “Unresolved” means that no verified solution is currently available; the record provides investigation progress, evidence, and stop conditions.

## Do these three things first

1. Preserve the complete error text, occurrence time, product version, and failure stage. Sanitize before sharing.
2. Separate visibility, continuation, request, and local-data failures. Do not apply a fix based only on a similar-looking symptom.
3. Before changing sessions, databases, accounts, remote state, or resending actions, preserve the evidence and check for existing side effects.

## Directory rules

- Top-level directories classify the failure layer. Every public case has a stable `TRB-xxx` ID and its own folder. `TRB` means Troubleshooting Record; it is only a unique index and does not indicate severity.
- Main record files use a type-first prefix: HTTP cases use `HTTP-<three-digit status>-TRB-<three-digit case ID>-topic.md`; other system/protocol signatures use `ERR-...` or `SYS-...`. Sort multiple codes numerically and omit unconfirmed codes.
- Keep the main record, investigation, evidence register, and companion tool with the case. Resolution status and tool status are independent.
- Keep license and implementation-difference notes beside the relevant tool.
- Evidence-free material stays in the Git-ignored `90-本地草稿/` area until it meets the record template's minimum evidence requirements.
- Paths may change, but case IDs are never reused. When cases merge, preserve old-ID mappings and migration notes.

This directory was first reorganized under these rules on 2026-09-08. Paths based on temporary problem names are no longer entry points. Their earlier contents remain traceable through Git history; public references should use the stable `TRB-xxx` IDs.

Use the [Chinese record template](故障记录模板.md) or the [English template](TROUBLESHOOTING_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md) for new cases.

## Maintenance lifecycle

1. **Capture:** record a one-sentence symptom, error signature, version, time, and minimum sanitized evidence.
2. **Classify:** create or reuse a case ID and separate confirmed facts, reasonable inference, and open questions.
3. **Validate:** reproduce with copies, synthetic data, or read-only checks first; preserve failed attempts and stop conditions.
4. **Publish:** show resolution status, tool state, last-verified date, and evidence boundary at the top.
5. **Maintain:** revalidate after product, data-format, configuration, or evidence changes. Mark obsolete cases as retired while preserving useful history.

## Tool status

- [`TRB-001` archive repair tool](<01-会话与归档/TRB-001-Windows归档路径异常/TRB-001-2-thread-store-归档路径缺失.md#四最简单的使用方式双击-exe>): a Windows local tool that repairs one path field and does not archive tasks. The checked-in executable is unsigned; read its boundary before use.
- [`TRB-005` migration research material](<02-账号与供应商切换/TRB-005-迁移后分页谱系损坏/迁移工具研究材料-真实操作已暂停/README.en.md>): installation and rollback against real data are suspended. Only synthetic tests and source review are allowed.

## Publication and safety boundaries

- These records are not official fixes from OpenAI or third-party projects. Revalidate when versions, private data structures, or provider behavior change.
- Do not publish raw JSONL, databases, full prompts, real task IDs, accounts, credentials, internal route names, absolute paths, or generated scan reports.
- Public error samples use `<PROVIDER_NAME>`, `<MODEL_NAME>`, `<THREAD_ID>`, `<PORT>`, and `<USER_HOME>`.
- When citing third-party projects, state the source, license, implementation differences, and last-verified date. Do not imply an official partnership.

## Public references

- [CC Switch: Unified Codex session history](https://github.com/farion1231/cc-switch/blob/main/docs/guides/codex-unified-session-history-guide-en.md)
- [CC Switch releases](https://github.com/farion1231/cc-switch/releases)

Dates and versions in historical cases describe the environment at that time. Use the status and “last verified” fields at the top of each case to judge applicability.
